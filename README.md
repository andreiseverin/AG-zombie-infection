This plugin works for Adrenaline Gamer and aims to bring a new type of training : movement. When the round starts, each player have 15 seconds to hide. Then, a random player will be infected. He has 2 minutes to infect all other players. After 2 minutes, the plane with supplies will arrive and the humans alive will receive random weapons. They need to pay attention. Zombies still can infect them. The round ends when there's no more zombies or humans left alive.

## How to install
- Copy all the resources in your `ag` folder
- Activate the plugin `ag_zombie.amxx` in `amxmodx/config/plugins.ini`
- Activate the gamemode by typing `zombie` in console
- Have fun
